''' 
Exercise 1: Write a while loop starting that begins with the last character in a string
and which reads backwards to the first char.
Make it print each letter on it's own line, backwards.
'''

fruit = 'banana'
index = -5
while index < len(fruit) -5:
    letter = fruit[index]
    # print(index)
    print(letter)
    index = index + 1
