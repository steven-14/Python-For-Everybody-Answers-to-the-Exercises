Exercise 7.1
Exercise 1: Write a program to read through a file and print the contents of the file (line by line) 
all in upper case. Executing the program will look as follows:
'''

# open the file
fh = open('mbox-short.txt')
# make a loop to print the file
for lx in fh:
#strip out the spaces at end and returns
    ly = lx.rstrip()
# make it upper case and print it
    print(lx.upper())
